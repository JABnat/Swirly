CSS project using JavaScript to replicate the award winning design from Camille Mormal

This personal project is intended to train Frontend skills using JavaScript and animations. 
The focus here is the use of translate, dataset and calculating the position of the mouse using onmouseup, onmousedown, and onmouse move. 

The difficulties I faced were to properly caluclate the prevPercentage. I continuously received console errors stating that the percentage value was NaN. 



** This project was possible thanks to a Youtube tutorial from the user Hyperplexed, entitled "Award winning Animation With Only 20 Lines of CSS?"
